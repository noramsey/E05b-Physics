I know for a fact that Main1 and Main2 are correct, but Main i simply didn't know what to do. I'm pretty sure at some point the assignment was updated on github and changed from the version I was working on, but the new version of the assignment seemed even more difficult. I ripped out the code from the first version and plugged it into the second version, because I couldn't even imagine myself getting that far without doing so, then when it came down to editing the new version to make the collisions seem more 'Accurate' I don't think I conserved momentum, but I did make the interaction between the animals less hinky. 

For this assignment I think I only really learned a few things. 
    1. How to access attributes of arrays (Or objects?) for example: a.mass would mean '1'. 
    2. if statements are where I need to start if I want something to occur as an event.
